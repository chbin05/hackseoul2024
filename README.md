### Why People Use GC
The experience of being free from environmental pollution shows that environmental improvement is not difficult.
This is a service that everyone can participate in.
I don’t do it alone, anyone can report and collect trash.
It is cute and fun service.
It can be used lightly in everyday life as if it were a Pokémon!
